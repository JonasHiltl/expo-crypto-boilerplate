This is a fork of [node-libs-expo](https://github.com/annie-elequin/node-libs-expo) with some dependencies updates which is a fork of [node-libs-react-native](https://github.com/parshap/node-libs-react-native) with some minor changes to make it work in a Expo managed App. Thanks to those package authors for doing the hard work.
